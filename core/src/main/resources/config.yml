updates:
  # Sets if the plugin should check for new versions. The plugin will check via the LaivyCodes repository.
  # This helps ensure that the plugin is up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
  check: true

  # Sets if the plugin should be automatically updated if there's a new available version.
  # Automatic updates provide convenience but may introduce changes unexpectedly.
  # Note: This setting is ignored if 'check' is set to false.
  auto: true

whitelist:
  # If false, premium users (those who have purchased the game) will not be able to join the server.
  # This setting allows server administrators to control access based on the user type.
  allow-premium-users: true

  # If false, cracked users (those who are using unauthorized copies of the game) will not be able to join the server.
  # This helps prevent unauthorized access and maintain server integrity.
  allow-cracked-users: true

premium-automatic-auth:
  # When enabled, premium users will not need to authenticate using commands.
  # The plugin differentiates between premium and cracked users as follows:
  # 1. The client attempts to connect to the server.
  # 2. The server sends a message prompting the client to reconnect.
  # 3. The player must reconnect for verification.
  #    - If the verification process fails, the client is considered a cracked user and must enter a password.
  #    - If the verification process is successful, the player is considered a premium user and will not need to enter a password for future logins, provided they use a premium account.
