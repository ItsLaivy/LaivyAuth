# Sets the debug state of the plugin.
# If true, the plugin will send detailed logs that may
# be useful for developers to see exactly what's happening at the plugin.
debug: false

updates:
  # Sets the time in minutes that the plugin should check for new mappings and plugin updates.
  # Leave it "-1" if you want to disable the update checks
  check: 60

  # Sets if the plugin should be automatically updated if there's a new available version.
  # Automatic updates provide convenience but may introduce changes unexpectedly.
  # Note: This setting is ignored if 'check' is set to false.
  auto: true

premium-automatic-auth:
  # When enabled, premium users will not need to authenticate using commands.
  # The plugin differentiates between premium and cracked users as follows:
  # 1. The client attempts to connect to the server.
  # 2. The server sends a message prompting the client to reconnect.
  # 3. The player must reconnect for verification.
  #    - If the verification process fails, the client is considered a cracked user and must enter a password.
  #    - If the verification process is successful, the player is considered a premium user and will not need to enter a password for future logins, provided they use a premium account.
  enabled: true

  # The allowlist feature requires the premium automatic auth enabled.
  whitelist:
    # If false, cracked users (those who are using unauthorized copies of the game) will not be able to join the server.
    # This helps prevent unauthorized access and maintain server integrity.
    # Useful when you need to block cracked users temporarily or just want to use
    # our amazing and wonderful authentication plugin without necessarily having cracked users, for api
    # as example.
    allow-cracked-users: true

email:
  # Defines if the players should be forced to enter an e-mail to authenticate
  required: false
