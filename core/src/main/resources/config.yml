# Sets the debug state of the plugin.
# If true, the plugin will send detailed logs that may
# be useful for developers to see exactly what's happening at the plugin.
debug: false

# When this option is enabled, nicknames with the same characters but differing
# in case (uppercase or lowercase) will be considered identical.
# For example, if there is an account created with the nickname "Laivy",
# attempting to connect with the nickname "laivy" will prevent the user from
# proceeding with authentication.
#
# The native notchian (vanilla) minecraft servers allow this as default.
# Keeping this as true if strongly recommended, it avoids a lot of issues.
case-sensitive-nicknames: true

# Stops the server if an error occurs while loading the plugin
# You don't want your server running without the authentication system, trust me.
stop-server-if-fails: true

updates:
  # Sets the time in minutes that the plugin should check for new mappings and plugin updates.
  # Leave it "-1" if you want to disable the update checks
  check: 60

  # Sets if the plugin should be automatically updated if there's a new available version.
  # Automatic updates provide convenience but may introduce changes unexpectedly.
  # Note: This setting is ignored if 'check' is set to false.

premium-automatic-auth:
  # When enabled, premium users will not need to authenticate using commands.
  # The plugin differentiates between premium and cracked users as follows:
  # 1. The client attempts to connect to the server.
  # 2. The server sends a message prompting the client to reconnect.
  # 3. The player must reconnect for verification.
  #    - If the verification process fails, the client is considered a cracked user and must enter a password.
  #    - If the verification process is successful, the player is considered a premium user and will not need to enter a password for future logins, provided they use a premium account.
  # Note this feature will make the server online-mode=true, but cracked users still can join.
  enabled: true

whitelist:
  # If false, cracked users (those who are using unauthorized copies of the game) will not be able to join the server.
  # This helps prevent unauthorized access and maintain server integrity.
  # Useful when you need to block cracked users temporarily or just want to use
  # our amazing and wonderful authentication plugin without necessarily having cracked users.
  # For api purposes as example.
  #
  # To use this feature, the 'premium-automatic-auth' must be enabled.
  allow-cracked-users: true

  # Here you can block some protocol versions to join the server.
  # That will prevent clients from connecting with unwanted client versions.
  # Here's the full versions list: https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers
  block-protocol-versions:
  #  - 767 # This blocks the 1.21
  #  - 766 # This blocks the 1.20.6 and 1.20.5
